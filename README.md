Smart Home System Simulation
Welcome to our final project, which simulates a smart home system integrating multiple subsystems such as lighting control, a smart door, fire and gas detection, rain detection, and a water system.

Features:
Lighting System: A system to control home lighting with adjustable brightness.
Smart Door System: A secure door system that responds to password input and proximity detection.
Fire and Gas Detection System: Detects hazardous gases and fires, triggering alarms.
Rain Detection System: Monitors rainfall and interacts with other subsystems.
Water System: Controlled by an AI model that determines whether to pump water to the soil based on moisture levels.
Included Components:
Arduino Code: Embedded C++ code to interface with the hardware components.
Flutter App: Dart code for the mobile app that communicates with the home system.
AI Model: Machine learning model for water management, along with code and results.
Documentation: Detailed presentation covering all subsystems with descriptions, schematics, and diagrams.
Videos and Schematics: Demonstrations of the system in action, along with complete project schematics and design maquettes.
